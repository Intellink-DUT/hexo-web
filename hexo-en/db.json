It has a mass of 17 kg and dimensions of 1012.3mmx428mmx403mm (expanded). The satellite utilizes the self-owned X-band ground control station of Dalian University of Technology (the first ground station in Liaoning Province) for tracking and control. Its main objectives are to validate high-resolution remote sensing imaging, domestic highly reliable OpenHarmony operating system, advanced satellite subsystem components, and a series of innovative technologies including a ultralight deployer based on 3D printing.\n\nThe primary payload of the satellite is a high-resolution multispectral camera with five spectral bands, including panchromatic and multispectral capabilities. It enables cost-effective submeter high-resolution observations of oceans and Earth from space.The use of the OpenHarmony operating system and domestic processing chips significantly improves the system's performance and reliability. Unlike traditional satellites that use toxic hydrazine propellants for attitude and orbit control, this satellite employs an innovative hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) monopropellant propulsion system. It offers advantages such as being environmentally friendly, non-toxic, high-energy, low-power consumption, and pre-packaged, greatly enhancing the micro-nanosatellite's maneuverability in orbit.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, at approximately 14:00 Beijing time, the Lianli Satellite was successfully released into orbit from the Tianzhou-6 cargo spacecraft.

It represents an advanced level of satellite remote sensing in the same category and plays a crucial role in the development of related fields. Additionally, the ultralight deployer will validate a series of advanced technologies, including overall 3D printing technology, multi-satellite release and status monitoring controller technology, and memory alloy separation nut unlocking mechanism. The Lianli Satellite also incorporates a range of innovative advanced technologies, such as HAN green and non-toxic propulsion technology, integrated attitude measurement technology, and domestic OpenHarmony real-time operating system. These advancements hold significant importance for the development of domestic micro-nano satellites, laying the foundation for the research and application of the next generation of high performance micro-nano satellites. The satellite mainly verified:\n\n- High-resolution remote sensing imaging at 1m@500km\n- Lightweight, high reliability, OpenHarmony real-time operating system\n- Advanced satellite subsystem components\n- Ultralight deployer based on 3D printing technology\n\n## R&D Process\n\nThe Lianli Satellite project was initiated on April 24, 2020. From April to October of the same year, it completed scientific objective verification, including remote sensing observations and payload integration. In October 2020, through a naming activity open to the entire university's faculty, students, and alumni, the satellite was named \"Lianli.\" Led by Professor Xia Guangqing and Professor Yu Xiaozhou, the team completed the overall satellite design and subsystem detailed design in 2021. In December 2022, the satellite passed the payload review for integration with Tianzhou-6. Starting from January 2022, the team began the development, assembly, and testing of the satellite and deployer. In March 2023, the Lianli Satellite was successfully delivered to Tianzhou-6.\n\n![Professor Yu and Lianli Satellite](https://intellink-01.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/lianli/%E5%A4%A7%E8%BF%9E1%E5%8F%B7%E2%80%94%E8%BF%9E%E7%90%86%E5%8D%AB%E6%98%9F%E5%9C%A8%E6%B5%B7%E5%8D%97%E6%96%87%E6%98%8C%E5%8F%91%E5%B0%84%E5%9C%BA.jpg)\nProfessor Yu and Lianli Satellite\n\n- Project Startup： April 24, 2020（Aerospace Day）；\n- Scientific Objective Verification：April to October 2020.
