## Characteristics of micronautical satellites

![Weight](https://intellink-01.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/microsatellite_inf/Weight.png)

Micro-nano-satellites refer to satellites weighing 10 kg to 100 kg. Compared with large satellites, micro-nano-satellites have the advantages of light weight, small size, low cost, short development cycle and easier networking to form satellite constellations, thus playing an increasingly important role in the fields of communications, remote sensing and electronic reconnaissance.（The latest data are available at [nanosats](https://www.nanosats.eu/)）
