The Intellink Society of Astronautics (Inetellink) was established on January 3, 2024 as a student club of Dalian University of Technology (DUT). In the context of the rapid development of global aerospace, Inetellink was initiated by the students, ourselves. Based on the application of Professor Yu Xiaozhou's research group, it aims to establish an experimental workshop for the design of microsatellites and ground measurement and control station. Through various forms such as social practice and exchange meetings, it actively promotes aerospace science popularization activities, explores the stories of aerospace professionals, and promotes campus aerospace culture.
